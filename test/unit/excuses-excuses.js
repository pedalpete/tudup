SACRE BLU!! 
WHY ARE THERE NO TESTS??

Sorry about that, I've got a bit of a unique node build (because I've been building embedded linux node.js developer tools), and as a result, I can't run any modules that need to installed globally. 

Normally this isn't a problem, as I can run jasmine-node for webkit apps, but unfortunately, I was getting nothing but errors when trying to run tests, so ended up not including them.

I like tests, and TDD, so I'll have to sort out my build system. But I haven't been doing front-end development on this machine.
